#### Characteristic of Production Code
* CLEAN: readable, simple, and concise. A characteristic of production quality code that is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.

* MODULAR: logically broken up into functions and modules. Also an important characteristic of production quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.

*MODULE*: a file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.

#### Code refactoring

**REFACTORING:** restructuring your code to improve its internal structure, without changing its external functionality. This gives you a chance to clean and modularize your program after you've got it working.

#### Writting Clean Code
* Meaningfull Names
* Nice Whitespace
    * Organize your code with consistent indentation - the standard is to use 4 spaces for each indent.
    * Separate sections with blank lines to keep your code well organized and readable.
    * Try to limit your lines to around 79 characters, which is the guideline given in the PEP 8 style guide.
