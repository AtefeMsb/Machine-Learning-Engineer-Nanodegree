    "\n",
    "3. in order for virtal machine to excute the training code successfully needs to access the training data. SageMaker assumes that this data is on S3, which is amazon data storage service. so we need to make sure we upload the dataset there."

The `upload_data` function should be close to the top of the list! You'll also see functions like `train`, `tune`, and `create_model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role** - Sometimes called the execution role, this is the IAM role that you created when you created your notebook instance. The role basically defines how data that your notebook uses/creates will be stored. You can even try printing out the role with `print(role)` to see the details of this creation."

These are similar to file folders that contain data and metadata about that data, such as the data size, date of upload, author, and so on."
