    "One thing to note is that it’s often easiest to form clusters when you have low-dimensional data. For example, it can be difficult, and often noisy, to get good clusters from data that has over 100 features. In high-dimensional cases, there is often a dimensionality reduction step (like PCA) that takes place before data is analyzed by a clustering algorithm. "
